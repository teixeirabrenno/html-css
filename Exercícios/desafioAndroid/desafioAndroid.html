                </div>
                <p>You probably know that the <a href="https://developer.android.com/about?gclid=Cj0KCQiAm4WsBhCiARIsAEJIEzWR8KGZjkfpT6yXMq05XAf47SeoORBLZxY3QXek_vviw6kmm2haNhgaAngvEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds&hl=pt-br" target="_blank" rel="external">Android &#x1F517;</a> operational system, held by Google, is one of the most used systems in the world for mobile devices. However, you certainly don't know that its mascot has a name and an interesting history behind it. Check out this website to get to know more about this little robot.</p>

                <div class="h2">
                    <h2>First version</h2>
                </div>
                <p>The first attempt to create a mascot for Android surged in 2007 and came from a developer called <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/morrildl" target="_blank" rel="external">Dan Morril &#x1F517;</a>. He says that he opened InkScape up and created his own version of the robot. His objective at first was to personalize the system for the team he worked with, not because it was requested by the company he worked for, but simply because he wanted.</p>

                <p>This first version were named after its creator. They were called the Dandroids.</p>

                <div class="h2">
                    <h2>Second version</h2>
                </div>
                <p>The idea of having a mascot to represent the company escalated and it was passed to a professional in the design field. The russian illustrator and employee of Google, <a href="https://www.irinablok.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Irina Blok &#x1F517;</a>, got the mission of designing the robot in a way that it looks more friendly.</p>

                </picture>
                <p>Irina's main idea was to represent everything graphically with just a few traces and a more plain 2D design. The second point was to design a rapidly identified logo from whoever sees it. From that, the new mascot of Android, <span>BugDroid</span>, was born.</p>

                    <img src="imagens/bugdroid.png" alt="" id="imgBugDroid">
                </div>
                <p>The main inspiration to design BugDroid came from those bathroom doors' sticks that are used to identify the gender of the bathrooms.
                The legend has it that when the illustrator was creating the design, she looked sideways just to see the bathroom and the identification was imediate: simple, clean and straight to the point.

                    <p>Another curious fact about Android is that each version is named after a sweet, in alphabetic order, since version 1.5 until 9.0.</p>

                        Unfortunately, Android Q didn't come to exist since Google decided to end this fun practice and started using numbering, which in turn birthed <a href="https://www.android.com/intl/pt_br/android-10/" target="_blank" rel="external">Android 10 &#x1F517;</a>.
                    </p>
